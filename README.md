BMCphyloannotation
==================

Where I store my annotations on the inital corpus of Open Access BMC PDFs


The csv file contains the list of PDFs, metadata on them from Mendeley Bibtex export (columns D to N, this data may not be correct, or fully filled-in!)

Columns O to S are generated metadata from 'pdfinfo' 

Column A (notes) and Columns T to BZ are for manual annotation...
