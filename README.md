BMCphyloannotation
==================

Where I store my annotations on the inital corpus of Open Access BMC PDFs


The csv file contains the list of PDFs, metadata on them from Mendeley Bibtex export (columns D to N, this data may not be correct, or fully filled-in!)

Columns O to S are generated metadata from 'pdfinfo' 

Column A (notes) and Columns T to BZ are for manual annotation based solely on the figure or figure caption (thus in some it is not possible to score the method of inference as that is only discussed in the full text)
